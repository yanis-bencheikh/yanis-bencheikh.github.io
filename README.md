Hi! This is my personal GitHub pages website! 

# Description

It currently displays a tiny project where I utilised **HTML, CSS and Git** to familiarise myself with web development. 

# Usage

- You can perform normal search using either Google or Duck Duck Go search engines on the main page by inputting your search query in the input bar and pressing enter.

- If you want to land directly on the first listed website outputted by Google, you can input your search query and click on the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.   

- You can navigate to the image search page on the top right by clicking the hyperlink and perform an image search using either Google's or Duck Duck Go's search engine.

- You can navigate to the advanced search page on the top right by clicking the hyperlink and perform a partially implemented advanced search using Google's search engine.
